# jQuery Number Formatter

`jqueryNumberFormatter` is a small and simple jQuery library for formatting numbers as the user types into an input field.

The library adds a thousands separator and decimal separator to the input value, as well as restricts input to valid numbers and decimal places. It also allows real-time formatting of numbers above a thousand, including adding a separator as the user types.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

### Installing

1. Download the `jqueryNumberFormatter.js` file and include it in your HTML file after the jQuery library is loaded:

```html
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
<script src="jqueryNumberFormatter.js"></script>
